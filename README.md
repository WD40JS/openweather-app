## Challenges
I was unable to retrieve data from the forecast api call so had to resort to using the current api for this action. 
I was unable to add dates successfully in order to call forecasts.
UV and date were unretreivable for an unknown reason as they weren't called in the weather json data that was returned. 
All time was devoted to these tasks and a new key was given for the forecast api to retrieve data.

## Application 
Application works as follows.
Displays UV,Temp,Wind,Time and Humidity for five day forecast.
